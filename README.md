# Download Time Remaining

Calculates and formats the time remaining until your download is finished, given your Download Size (MB) and your Download Speed (MB/s).

Sometimes, software or games launchers don't display the estimated time remaining until the end of your download.
I got frustrated by it multiple times and finally decided to create a simple tool to get a rough estimation (assuming my Download Speed is stable).

If it's useful to even 1 person ever, then that was worth it.
